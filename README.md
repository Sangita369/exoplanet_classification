Exoplanet Classification using Random Forest

1. Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying exoplanets using a Random Forest machine learning model. The dataset contains features extracted from astronomical observations, helping to determine whether a celestial body is an exoplanet or not. The primary goal is to develop a reliable classification model that can assist astronomers in identifying potential exoplanets efficiently.

2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists Light curve variations features
Each sample in the dataset is labeled as either an exoplanet (positive class) or non-exoplanet (negative class).

3. Technologies Used
